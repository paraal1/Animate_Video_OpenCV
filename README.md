# OpenCV Animation Project

This project demonstrates how to create an animated video using OpenCV in C++. It overlays text bubbles onto character images, simulating a conversation through a series of frames. The program generates six frames, each containing a different line of dialogue, along with an introductory and concluding screen.

## Features
- **Text Bubble Creation**: Dynamically generates text bubbles that contain conversation text.
- **Image Overlay**: Combines character images with text bubbles using alpha blending.
- **Frame Generation**: Creates multiple frames for a complete animation sequence.
- **Intro and Outro**: Displays an introductory and concluding screen in the animation.
- **Video Creation**: Compiles all frames into a video file.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the required images (`oameni.jpg` for characters and `chat.png` for the text bubble) are present in the specified directory.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. The output will include individual frames and a final video file named `output_video.avi`.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV 4.10.0
- C++ Standard Library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Set up OpenCV in your development environment.

## Code Overview
- The `create_animation` function handles the generation of each frame, including text positioning and image blending.
- The main function orchestrates the creation of frames and the compilation of the final video.

## Output
- The program generates images for each animation frame and saves them as `output_image{frame_number}.png`.
- The introductory and concluding screens are saved as `image_intro.png` and `image_outro.png`, respectively.
- The final video is saved as `output_video.avi`.

## Example Dialogues
1. "Salut, ce faci?"
2. "Uite bine, tu?"
3. "Eu plec spre cinema."
4. "Foarte bine, la ce film?"
5. "'Candidatul Perfect'"
6. "Super, vizionare placuta!"
